# Prefix (Polish) Notation Solver

This is a challenge that aims to solve basic math operations writen with the Prefix Notation (Polish Notation), which sets the operations before the numbers (example: + 2 3).

To solve the challenge i've implemented some interesting things with Python 3, such as:
- Lambda Expressions
- Text Splitting
- Data Slicing
- Dictionaries
- Lists
- Stacks
- Ranges
